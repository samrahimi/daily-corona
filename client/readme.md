# The Daily Corona

This repository contains an archival tool for automating the process of capturing 2019-nCoV ("coronavirus") statistics and saving them to the Arweave blockchain. It also provides a client webapp for navigating this data and 
exporting what you need for further analysis in the software of your choice. 

For more info please [try the app](https://samrahimi.github.io)!

This codebase is currently a mess because this thing was quickly hacked together... If you're inspired by the nature of this project and want to 
help take it to the next level, we'd love to have you!
